# timekill

Timekill is an app for your phone that suggests healthy ways for you to waste your time.

Most of us are guilty of using our phones too much, which wouldn't be a problem if most of the use was actually healthy. Instead we spend far more than the optimal number of hours on social media, YouTube, Netflix, etc.

What if there was an app that suggested [healthy alternatives](#healthy-timekill) we could wire our brains to compulsively open instead?

What I suggest is a typical infinite-scrolling type feed, the one that we're used to from our bad habits (that apparently works well for addicting our brains), that serves cards with *healthy* and *productive* content.


## Healthy timekill

Here's a list of healthy ways to kill time:

 - Finishing a task on your TODO list
 - Using learning apps like Brilliant/Khan Academy/Coursera/EdX/Duolingo
 - Getting the top recommended healthy/useful content across feeds (see my wiki on [The Importance of Open Recommender Systems](https://erik.bjareholt.com/wiki/importance-of-open-recommendation-systems/))
 - Show a card with the number of productive hours today
   - You could do the same for unproductive hours, but I'm not sure that would be very helpful as it basically just shames the user (which could lead to counterproductive results)
 - Staying in touch with friends we haven't talked to in a while (as some personal relationship management systems aim to help the user do)


## Ideas

 - Integrate with ActivityWatch to track how many productive hours timekill helped initiate.
 - Add rewards for 
 -


## Timeline

### Pre-MVP

 - Set up a ProductHunt ship page (to build a mailing list of people who are interested)
   - Link from personal, ActivityWatch, and Thankful accounts on social media
   - Share in local college/programming/startup communities (Code@LTH, D-sektionen community, Lund Startups, Malm√∂ Startups)


### MVP

How do we build an MVP that users like as quickly as possible?

 - Focus on getting the user to think about good ways to kill time, then let them create cards to show in the feed themselves.

Ideas:

 - Integrate with ActivityWatch for synergistic effects on development (might be past the MVP stage, but there should definitely be a plan for it)


## Name

Current name was just how the one I happened to impulsively use when thinking about it. It might need improvement.
